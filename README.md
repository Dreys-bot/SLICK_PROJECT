# SLICK_PROJECT with JAVA
In this project, I build a memory games with Java.

## Concept
The goal of this project is to find all the pairs of cards in a grid. The game has 2 levels, the first which is easy and the second, the most difficult because we must find 3 cards each round.

## Used Technologies
The language used is Java. We have imported many library like:
* Slick.Graphics
* Slick.BasicGame
* Slick.slickException, etc.

## Structure
For the conception of the project, I built many class like: 
* card: This class is to represent each card of the grid
* case: To represent the place of each card
* ExitTest: To end a party
* Help: To give the instruction of the game
* Level: To implement the level1  


* Level2: To implement the level2


* Menu: To implement the different option of the game like: level1, level2, help,exit.



## Results
The result is look like:
